system32
========

my system32 template for windows systems. you'll notice that this repository is empty apart from this readme.
this is intentional, because i've done some tidying up. turns out you don't need /any/ of the files in this folder.


How to use
==========

To use this template, simply delete your current system32 folder and then from your command line git tools, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/mattarnster/system32.git %windir%/system32
```

Please note that because you've deleted the system32 folder, the likelyhood of this working is extremely rare. You are now free to bang your head against the table, and sit on the naughty step because you followed these instructions.
